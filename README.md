# Predictive-Neural-Network-Model
Model to predict whether a person X will buy a product Y or not.

Problem Statement:
The task is to predict the probability that a person X will buy a product Y. There are a bunch of largely demographic related features available about person X. There are also features available around Xâ€™s past activities. We also have aggregated data about people who typically buy product Y available as features (their demographics and past activities). We however do not know which features are which with certainty. The variable C tells us if the person X actually bought the product Y. Please provide a program/script that can take a tab delimited file with these 22 features and output a file with the index and the predicted output (1 or 0).
